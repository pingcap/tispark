# TiSpark push down


## Overview
TiSpark can push down some operators to TiKV
- predicate
- aggregate
- sort
- limit
- topN

Here is the detail table:

- min/max(time) will get wrong data now
- min/max(set) may cause TiKV panic now

## Aggregate

Aggregate push down is supported since TiSpark 2.5.0

Here are some limits:
- Sum(float) can't be pushed down because Spark will cast float to double, but `cast` can't be pushed down in TiSpark.
- Count(set) can't be pushed down because TiKV does not support set type.
- Count(col1,col2,...) can't be pushed down because TiDB/TiKV does not support Count(col1,col2,...).
- Avg can be pushed down when both the sum and count can be pushed down.
