TiSpark is a thin layer built for running Apache Spark on top of TiDB/TiKV to answer complex OLAP queries. It enjoys the merits of both the Spark platform and the distributed clusters of TiKV while seamlessly integrated to TiDB, a distributed OLTP database, to provide one-stop Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) solutions for online transactions and analyses.

The figure below show the architecture of TiSpark.

![architecture](./docs/architecture.png)

+ TiSpark integrates well with the Spark Catalyst Engine. It provides precise control of computing, which allows Spark to read data from TiKV efficiently. It also supports index seek, which significantly improves the performance of the point query execution.
+ It utilizes several strategies to push down computing to reduce the size of dataset handling by Spark SQL, which accelerates query execution. It also uses the TiDB built-in statistical information for the query plan optimization.
+ From the perspective of data integration, TiSpark + TiDB provides a solution that performs both transaction and analysis directly on the same platform without building and maintaining any ETLs. It simplifies the system architecture and reduces the cost of maintenance.
+ In addition, you can deploy and utilize the tools from the Spark ecosystem for further data processing and manipulation on TiDB. For example, using TiSpark for data analysis and ETL, retrieving data from TiKV as a data source for machine learning, generating reports from the scheduling system and so on.

TiSpark relies on the availability of TiKV clusters and PDs. You also need to set up and use the Spark clustering platform.

Most of the TiSpark logic is inside a thin layer, namely, the [tikv-client](https://github.com/pingcap/tispark/tree/master/tikv-client) library.

## Limitations

- TiDB starts to support `view` since `tidb-3.0`. TiSpark currently **does not support** `view`. Users are not be able to observe or access data through `view` with TiSpark.

- Spark config `spark.sql.runSQLOnFiles` should not be set to `false`, or you may got `Error in query: Table or view not found` error.

- Using the style of "{db}.{table}.{colname}" in the condition is not supported, e.g. `select * from t where db.t.col1 = 1`.

- `Null in aggregration` is not supported, e.g. `select sum(null) from t group by col1`.

- The dependency `tispark-assembly` should not be packaged into `JAR of JARS` file (for example, build with spring-boot-maven-plugin), or you will get `ClassNotFoundException`. You can solve it by adding `spark-wrapper-spark-version` in your dependency or constructing another forms of jar file.

- TiSpark doesn't support collations now. `new_collations_enabled_on_first_bootstrap` should not be set to `true`.

- If `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` is false an overflow of sum(bigint) will not cause an error but “wrap” the result, or you can cast bigint to decimal to avoid the overflow.
