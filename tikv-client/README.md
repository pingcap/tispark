## Ti-Client in Java [Under Construction]

A Java client for [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb)/[TiKV](https://github.com/pingcap/tikv).
It is supposed to:
+ Communicate via [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/)
+ Talk to Placement Driver searching for a region
+ Talk to TiKV for reading/writing data and the resulted data is encoded/decoded just like what we do in TiDB.
+ Talk to Coprocessor for calculation push down

## How to build

The following command can install dependencies for you.
```
mvn package
```

this project is designed to hook with `pd` and `tikv` which you can find in `PingCap` github page.

When you work with this project, you have to communicate with `pd` and `tikv`. There is a script taking care of this. By executing the following commands, `pd` and `tikv` can be executed on background.
```
cd scripts
make pd
make tikv
```

## How to use for now
It is not recommended to use tikv java client directly; it is better to use together with `TiSpark`.  
If users want to find some way to quickly write/read data to tikv.this library https://github.com/tikv/client-java is recommended.
