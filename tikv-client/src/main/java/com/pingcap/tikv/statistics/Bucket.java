/**
 * Bucket is histogram element.
 *
 * <p>Bucket bound is the smallest and greatest values stored in the bucket. The lower and upper
 * bound are stored in bucket as lowerBound and upperBound.
 *
 * <p>A bucket count is the number of items stored in all previous buckets and the current bucket.
 * Bucket counts are always in increasing order.
 *
 * <p>A bucket repeat is the number of repeats of the greatest bucket value, it can be used to find
 * popular values.
 *
 * <p>Note that lowerBound and upperBound keys should be 'comparable objects', and these bounds are
 * encoded as `binary` type in TiDB. Intuitively, you should also use Keys encoded as binary format
 * to do comparison in row count estimation.
